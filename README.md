# SIGCOMMInclusivity
This code uses Python to measure the inclusivity of the SIGCOMM academic research conference by displaying gender and geographic distribution of the program over a 15-year time span. It uses a combination of the SIGCOMM website, manually-curated data, and a gender-guesser to determine the gender and geographic location of each SIGCOMM committee member.
